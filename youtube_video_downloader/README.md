## How it works
You type in the name of a video (or what you would write into the YouTube search bar), and the number one search result gets downloaded.

## Changing download path
To permanently change the path edit the `path` variable in `vdl.py`. To temporarily change the path, include it as a command line argument. For example: 
```C:\Codes\vdl.py D:\Downloads```

## Before using the script install `pytube`
Paste this into your terminal: `pip install pytube`
